## Deployments

* deployment provides a declarative updates pods and replica sets.
    
* It ensures desired state, scaling, rolling updates with zero downtime.
    
* rarely we use ReplicaSet directly; deployment handles it for us.
    

### Use Case

We have online app store running in kubernetes, we want 3 instances running at all times for reliability, when new version release it should update without downtime.

deployment.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: online-store
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: store
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: store
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: store-container
        image: mystore:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

### How it works?

* kunernetes ensures 3 pods of the app are always running.
    
* when you update image: mystore:2.0, deployments rolls out the new version gradually, keeping the app alive.
